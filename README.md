# README

This is a project using Ruby on Rails to make a link aggregator site similar to [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com)

Users can sign up, submit a link, as well as comment and upvote/downvote link submissions.

I created this project to teach myself more about creating active record associations and how to use the gem Devise.
